            <p>Stay true to yourself, yet always be open to learn. Work hard, and never give up on your dreams, even
                when nobody else believes they can come true but you. These are not cliches but real tools you need no
                matter what you do in life to stay focused on your path.</p>

            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p>When you're challenged to the extreme, you learn so much about yourself. And when you're willing to give
                that ultimate sacrifice, when you're willing to tackle a job or a task or a mission head-on and give
                100%, you can achieve amazing things because you're almost fearless.</p>

            <h3>Vision</h3>
            <p>
                Dreams can become a reality when we possess a vision that is characterized by the willingness to work
                hard, a desire for excellence, and a belief in our right and our responsiblity to be equal members of
                society.

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>Everyone has a purpose in life and a unique talent to give to others. And when we blend this unique
                talent with service to others, we experience the ecstasy and exultation of own spirit, which is the
                ultimate goal of all goals.

            <h2>Without Limits</h2>
            <p>You need to aim beyond what you are capable of. You must develop a complete disregard for where your
                abilities end. Try to do things that you're incapable of... If you think you're incapable of running a
                company, make that your aim... Make your vision of where you want to be a reality. Nothing is
                impossible.</p>

            <p>Don't let the expectations and opinions of other people affect your decisions. It's your life, not
                theirs. Do what matters most to you; do what makes you feel alive and happy. Don't let the expectations
                and ideas of others limit who you are. If you let others tell you who you are, you are living their
                reality â€” not yours. There is more to life than pleasing people. There is much more to life than
                following others' prescribed path. There is so much more to life than what you experience right now. You
                need to decide who you are for yourself. Become a whole being. Adventure.</p>
